description: >-
  A red-headed food (cough cough, dessert) lover and the youngest member of our
  team, Mackenzie has been with SCENAREX since 2018. Initially wanting to be a
  chemical engineer, she couldnâ€™t help but be seduced by the coding world,
  reoriented her career accordingly and now finds herself joyfully navigating
  the blockchain space.

  Her experience includes over 5 years of studies and internships as an IT
  analyst and application developer for both the public and private sector. She
  holds a Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.S.) in Chemical Engineering and
  Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Computer Technology.

  Mackenzie is in charge of the all aspects concerning the front-end development
  of our platforms, as well as ensuring an optimal user experience.
